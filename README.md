## Overview
This Python project simulates the operation of a soda factory over a given number of years.  
It models **resource production**, **soda creation**, **market demand**, and **financial performance** (sales and profit).  
Each month, the factory produces resources, manufactures soda, and sells based on market popularity â€” which fluctuates randomly and seasonally.

Results are visualized in a **matplotlib line graph** and exported to a **CSV file** for analysis.

## Features

-  **Dynamic Simulation:**  
  Runs for any number of years, with monthly production and sales cycles.

- **Growth System:**  
  Factory efficiency improves over time based on a user-defined growth rate.

-  **Market Popularity:**  
  Market demand changes monthly and seasonally, simulating real-world fluctuations.

-  **Profit Calculation:**  
  Revenue, production cost, and profit are computed monthly and displayed.

-  **Data Visualization:**  
  Generates a graph showing Sales and Profit over time.

-  **CSV Export:**  
  Saves all data (month, revenue, profit) into an easy-to-read CSV file.

##  Classes Breakdown

| Class | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Factory** | Handles production of water, sugar, and glass. Converts them into soda based on recipe and costs. |
| **Market** | Simulates changing demand and popularity. Affects monthly soda sales. |
| **Simulation** | Controls the simulation timeline, runs production/sales cycles, calculates finances, tracks data, and exports results. |

## Formula Details

- **Soda Recipe:**  
  `3 water + 2 sugar + 1 glass = 1 soda`

- **Production Cost (per soda):**  
  `(3 Ã— water_cost) + (2 Ã— sugar_cost) + (1 Ã— glass_cost)`

- **Revenue (per soda):**  
  `$3.25`

- **Profit:**  
  `Revenue - Production Cost`

- **Popularity Growth:**  
  Randomized between `-0.02` and `+0.03`, scaled by a monthly base value.
